# nixos-flake

My nixos flake. It will receive atomic upgrades until the day I die

## Structure breakdown

config/ -> config files to be linked by hm
misc/ -> generic nixos shit, doesn't get touched ever really
wall/ -> wallpapers for hyprlock, sddm and swww
home-manager/ -> configs for home-manager ran items note: zsh has part of the config here.
modules/ -> nix configured files, zsh alias here
nixvim/ -> neovim config (pretty awesome)
scripts/ -> shell scripts stored here.

## todo
pray every morning that sddm issue fixes itself as to avoid switching to something disgusting looking
rice tmux someday when I'm bored enough 
waybar additions, noted to myself somewhere else.
